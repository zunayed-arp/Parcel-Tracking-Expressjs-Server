-> Unable to generate an enrollment token for Kibana instances, try invoking `bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana`.

->  Configure other nodes to join this cluster:
-> On this node:
  - Create an enrollment token with `bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s node`.
  - Uncomment the transport.host setting at the end of config/elasticsearch.yml.
  - Restart Elasticsearch.
-> On other nodes:
  - Start Elasticsearch with `bin/elasticsearch --enrollment-token <token>`, using the enrollment token that you generated.
